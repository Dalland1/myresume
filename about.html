   <p>I love reading. Trust me. We can discuss. I may not know much, that it fully possible, but I listen and do not argue about what I don't know. Currently I am apllying to study philosophy abroad</p> 

   <p>Learnign is my biggest hobby. Literature, Cimenatography, Philosophy and Politics. Sound very basic right? </p>
   <p>Maybe</p>
   <p> We can discuss it, you will enjoy it.</p>
